## Customizing your site

### The home page

1. Reopen `_config.yml` and click the pencil icon to make edits.

1. Replace `My MATC Portfolio` on line 2 with a new title for your site.

1. Replace `This is a description of this site.` on line 3 with a new description for your site.

1. Replace `My portfolio in partial fullfillment of Texas Tech's MATC.` on line 4 with a new description. Note that while this text doesn't appear on the page, it affects SEO and will be displayed in search engine results.

1. Click **Commit changes** to publish your changes. Note that it may take up to 10 minutes for your changes to rollout.

#### Branding

Lines 7 and 8 of the `_config.yml` show you that the logo and background images are named `logo.png` and `placeholder-big.jpg`. It's quickest to leave `_config.yml` alone and upload new images with the same names to the images folder.

1. Go to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/background) and download any image.

1. Rename the image `placeholder-big.jpg`.

1. From the main repo page click **assets**, and then click **img** to open the images folder.

1. Click **Add a file**, and then click **Upload files**.

1. Drag and drop the image you downloaded from Unsplash, and then click **Commit changes**. Note that it may take up to 10 minutes for your changes to rollout.

   > Note that files with the same names will be replaced. If you uploaded files with different names, edit lines 7 and 8 in the `_config.yml` file to reflect the new names.

   You can repeat these steps to update the logo.

#### Social icons

1. Reopen `_config.yml` and click the pencil icon
   
   Lines 33 through 63 list the built-in social icons.

1. Add a `#` at the beginning of any line to remove an icon.

1. Delete the `#` at the beginning of any line and replplace `username` with your social media's username to add an icon.

1. Click **Commit changes** to publish your changes. Note that it may take up to 10 minutes for your changes to rollout.
